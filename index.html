Greetings, my name is Bryce Summers and I've been writing computational geometry and rendering algorithms for 6+ years. I've also written my fair share of computer algebra systems, data structures, font rendering systems, etc.

<br><br>

<b>I enjoy assisting artists and designers with their computer science needs</b>, especially where such assistance results in the creation of open-source software that solves 
interesting, hard problems.
I'm familiar with OpenFrameworks, Processing, and other popular toolkits for arts-engineering.
I think that I am rather good at translating technical papers into high-performance code and solving new problems.
I can work in C++, Javascript, Java, Python, or essentially any language you need.
<br><br>
I also have a broad background in the Fine Arts, especially bassoon playing and photography. I would be happy to employ any of my developed talents to help you out.

<h3> Testimonial </h3>

<div class='quote'>

"Bryce Summers has <i>saved my ass</i> on at least three occasions. One time he wrote a graph 
algorithm that had literally stumped me for fifteen years, enabling me to make a project that I'd essentially given up on. He also programmed a linear algebra solution that was key to making one of my major projects able to work in real time. Bryce is an exceptionally unusual person: a computer science expert who loves to work with artists and designers. He delivers performant, reliant code, and is a pleasure to work with. I recommend him without reservation!"

<h3> Past creative work </h3>
<div class='size1'>
<ul>
<li>For <a href="http://flong.com/projects/augmented-hand-series/">The Augmented Hand Series</a>, I implemented a reduction from
		<a href="https://github.com/ofZach/ofxPuppet"> ofxPuppet </a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPAK</a> and a boundary subdivision scheme called 
  		<a href="https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/ofxButterfly">ofxButterfly</a>. </li>
<li> I implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/zachlieberman/status/766551095313178625">offset curves</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_curve">Zachary Lieberman</a>, who went on the use them in some of <a href="https://twitter.com/zachlieberman/status/776829893296459776">his work</a>.
